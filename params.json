Before playing, make sure to sample your hand (preferably inside a brightly colored glove) so that OpenCV can track it. The game is played in 3D, therefore your paddle can be moved in 2 dimensions instead of just one.\r\n\r\nTo start a server, run `npm start`, and to connect as a client, run `python game.py` within the /game/app/ directory. \r\n\r\nCLASSIFIED\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
