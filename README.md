# PROJECT: FIELD PONY (aka CV-Pong)
Project for MIT Blueprint 2016

Instructions

Your goal is to move your hand to control your paddle and beat your opponent. Before playing, make sure to sample your hand (preferably inside a brightly colored glove) so that OpenCV can track it. The game is played in 3D, therefore your paddle can be moved in 2 dimensions instead of just one.

To start a server, run `npm start`, and to connect as a client, run `python game.py` within the /game/app/ directory.
