# PROJECT: FIELD PONY (aka CV-Pong)

**1st Place Creation at MIT Blueprint 2016!**

##Instructions

Your goal is to move your hand to control your paddle and beat your opponent. Before playing, make sure to sample your hand (preferably inside a brightly colored glove) by clicking on different parts of it using your mouse. The detection threshold used to calculate your paddle's location will be shown by a yellow outline and red dot. The game is played in 3D, therefore your paddle can be moved in 2 dimensions instead of just one.
